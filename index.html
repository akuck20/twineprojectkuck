      This is a game about college. It is also a game about growing up. It could be a game about relationships. It could be a game about loneliness.
      <br> <br> <br>
      Like many other things, this game is about nothing until you <a href="https://akuck20.github.io/twineprojectkuck/twine/donotpassgo.html">start</a>.
